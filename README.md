This repo is for me to learn more about RAG application

# What is RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) ?

**RAG**, is a technique to **enhance** the **quality of responses** generated by a *large language model* (LLM), by **augmenting its pre-trained knowledge with information retrieved from external sources**. This results is more accurate responses from the LLM by **grounding them in real, contextually relevant data**. 

# When to use RAG ?
RAG is best suited for the following:
- Tasks that **require very specific information** that you don't think will be present in the LLMs parametic knowledge, i.e. **information that is not widely available on the internet**
- Tasks that **require information** from **multiple different data sources**
- Tasks that involve **basic question-answering** or **summarization on a piece of information**

However, RAG is **not ideal** for tasks that require **complex multi-step reasoning**, **long-term planning**, or **deep deductive logic**. These tasks require more **sophisticated decision-making capabilities**, which are **better handled by agentic workflows**.

In simpler terms, RAG **excels** at **finding** and **synthesizing** information quickly but may **struggle** with tasks that require **continuous**, **adaptive reasoning over many steps**. Agentic workflows, which involve more dynamic and autonomous systems, are better suited for handling these more intricate tasks.
